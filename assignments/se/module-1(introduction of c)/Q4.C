//que:What is DFD ? Create a DFD diagram on Flipkart
 Ans:-  Data Flow Diagram (DFD) represents the flow of data within information systems. Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) provide a graphical
 representation of the data flow of a system that can be understood by both technical and non-technical users. The models enable software
 engineers, customers, and users to work together effectively during the analysis and specification of requirements.
  The flow of data in a system or process is represented by a Data Flow Diagram (DFD). It also gives insight into the inputs and outputs
 of each entity and the process itself. Data Flow Diagram (DFD) does not have a control flow and no loops or decision rules are present.
 Specific operations, depending on the type of data, can be explained by a flowchart. It is a graphical tool, useful for communicating
 with users, managers and other personnel. it is useful for analyzing existing as well as proposed systems.
 
 Types of Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

 There are two types of Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

1. Logical Data Flow Diagram
2. Physical Data Flow Diagram

1.Logical Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
Logical data flow diagram mainly focuses on the system process. It illustrates how data flows in the system. Logical Data Flow Diagram 
(DFD) mainly focuses on high level processes and data flow without diving deep into technical implementation details. Logical DFD is
 used in various organizations for the smooth running of system. Like in a Banking software system, it is used to describe how data is 
 moved from one entity to another.
 2.Physical Data Flow Diagram
Physical data flow diagram shows how the data flow is actually implemented in the system. In the Physical Data Flow Diagram (DFD),
 we include additional details such as data storage, data transmission, and specific technology or system components. Physical DFD is 
 more specific and close to implementation
Components of Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)

The Data Flow Diagram has 4 components:

Process: Input to output transformation in a system takes place because of process function. The symbols of a process are rectangular 
with rounded corners, oval, rectangle or a circle. The process is named a short sentence, in one word or a phrase to express its essence.

Data Flow: Data flow describes the information transferring between different parts of the systems. The arrow symbol is the symbol of 
data flow. A relatable name should be given to the flow to determine the information which is being moved. Data flow also represents 
material along with information that is being moved. Material shifts are model in systems that are not merely informative. A given flow 
should only transfer a single type of information. The direction of flow is represented by the arrow which can also be bi-directional.

Warehouse (Data Store) : The data is stored in the warehouse for later use. Two horizontal lines represent the symbol of the store. 
The warehouse is simply not restricted to being a data file rather it can be anything like a folder with documents, an optical disc, 
a filing cabinet. The data warehouse can be viewed independent of its implementation. When the data flow from the warehouse it is 
considered as data reading and when data flows to the warehouse it is called data entry or data updating.

Terminator (External Entity): The Terminator is an external entity that stands outside of the system and communicates with the system. 
It can be, for example, organizations like banks, groups of people like customers or different departments of the same organization,
 which is not a part of the model system and is an external entity. Modeled systems also communicate with terminator.
