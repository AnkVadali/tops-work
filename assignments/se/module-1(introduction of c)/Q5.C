//que: What is Flow chart ? Creat a flowchart to make addition of two numbers
Ans:- Q-5
A flowchart is a graphical representation of a process or algorithm. It uses various symbols to denote different types of actions or 
steps in a sequence, with arrows connecting them to indicate the flow of the process.

Here's a simple flowchart for adding two numbers:

Start: Begin the process.
Input A and B: Prompt the user to input two numbers, A and B.
Add A and B: Perform the addition of the two numbers.
Display Result: Show the result of the addition.
End: End the process.
To create a visual flowchart, you can use the following text description of the steps along with standard flowchart symbols:

Oval: Start and End
Parallelogram: Input/Output
Rectangle: Process
Arrow: Indicates the flow of the process
Here's the text representation of the flowchart:

(Input A and B)
   |
(Add A and B)

  (End)
For a graphical flowchart, you can use a tool like Microsoft Visio, draw.io, or even hand-draw it on paper. Here's a basic illustration 
of what it would look like:
