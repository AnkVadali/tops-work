System Software
System software is software that directly operates the computer hardware and provides the basic functionality to the users as well as
 to the other software to operate smoothly. Or in other words, system software basically controls a computer’s internal functioning 
 and also controls hardware devices such as monitors, printers, and storage devices, etc. It is like an interface between hardware 
 and user applications, it helps them to communicate with each other because hardware understands machine language(i.e. 1 or 0) whereas
  user applications are work in human-readable languages like English, Hindi, German, etc. so system software converts the 
  human-readable language into machine language and vice versa.
  Types of System Software
It has two subtypes which are:
Operating System: It is the main program of a computer system. When the computer system ON it is the first software that loads into 
the computer’s memory. Basically, it manages all the resources such as computer memory, CPU, printer, hard disk, etc., and provides an 
interface to the user, which helps the user to interact with the computer system. It also provides various services to other computer 
software. Examples of operating systems are Linux, Apple macOS, Microsoft Windows, etc.
Language Processor: As we know that system software converts the human-readable language into a machine language and vice versa. 
So, the conversion is done by the language processor. It converts programs written in high-level programming languages like Java,
 C, C++, Python, etc(known as source code), into sets of instructions that are easily readable by machines(known as object code or 
 machine code).
 Device Driver: A device driver is a program or software that controls a device and helps that device to perform its functions. 
 Every device like a printer, mouse, modem, etc. needs a driver to connect with the computer system eternally. So, when you connect 
 a new device with your computer system, first you need to install the driver of that device so that your operating system knows how 
 to control or manage that device
Application Software 
Software that performs special functions or provides functions that are much more than the basic operation of the computer is known 
as application software. Or in other words, application software is designed to perform a specific task for end-users. It is a product 
or a program that is designed only to fulfill end-users’ requirements. It includes word processors, spreadsheets, database management, 
inventory, payroll programs, etc.
Types of Application Software
There are different types of application software and those are:
General Purpose Software: This type of application software is used for a variety of tasks and it is not limited to performing a 
specific task only. For example, MS-Word, MS-Excel, PowerPoint, etc.
Customized Software: This type of application software is used or designed to perform specific tasks or functions or designed for 
specific organizations. For example, railway reservation system, airline reservation system, invoice management system, etc.
Utility Software: This type of application software is used to support the computer infrastructure. It is designed to analyzer, 
configure, optimize and maintains the system, and take care of its requirements as well. For example, antivirus, disk fragmenter, 
memory tester, disk repair, disk cleaners, registry cleaners, disk space analyzer, etc.
