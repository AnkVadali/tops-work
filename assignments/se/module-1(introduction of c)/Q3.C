What is Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?
SDLC is a process followed for software building within a software organization. SDLC consists of a precise plan that describes how to 
develop, maintain, replace, and enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a method for improving the quality of software and the
 all-around development process.  
Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. 
SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step

Listed the top five most popular SDLC models:-
1. Waterfall Model
It is the fundamental model of the software development life cycle. This is a very simple model. The waterfall model is not in practice 
anymore, but it is the basis for all other SDLC models. Because of its simple structure, the waterfall model is easier to use and 
provides a tangible output. In the waterfall model, once a phase seems to be completed, it cannot be changed, and due to this less 
flexible nature, the waterfall model is not in practice anymore.
2. Agile Model
The agile model in SDLC was mainly designed to adapt to changing requests quickly. The main goal of the Agile model is to facilitate 
quick project completion. The agile model refers to a group of development processes. These processes have some similar characteristics 
but also possess certain subtle differences among themselves.
4. Spiral Model
The spiral model in SDLC is one of the most crucial SDLC models that provides support for risk handling. It has various spirals 
in its diagrammatic representation; the number of spirals depends upon the type of project. Each loop in the spiral structure indicates 
the Phases of the spiral model.
5. V-Shaped Model
The V-shaped model in SDLC is executed in a sequential manner in V-shape. Each stage or phase of this model is integrated with a testing
 phase. After every development phase, a testing phase is associated with it, and the next phase will start once the previous phase is 
 completed, i.e., development & testing. It is also known as the verification or validation model.
 6. Big Bang Model
The Big Bang model in SDLC is a term used to describe an informal and unstructured approach to software development, where there is no 
specific planning, documentation, or well-defined phases.
