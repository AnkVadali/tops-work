// que:What is software ? What is software engineering ?
Ans :- Software:-
software is a collection of instructions, data, or computer programs that are used to run machines and carry out particular activities. 
It is the antithesis of hardware, which refers to a computer’s external components. A device’s running programs, scripts, and applications
 are collectively referred to as “software” in this context.

 Software engineering:- Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic
 and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software

1.	Software engineering includes a variety of techniques, tools, and methodologies, including requirements analysis, design, 
testing, and maintenance.

2.	It is a rapidly evolving field, and new tools and technologies are constantly being developed to improve the software development
 process.

3.	By following the principles of software engineering and using the appropriate tools and methodologies, software developers
 can create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software that meets the needs of its users.

4.	Software Engineering is mainly used for large projects based on software systems rather than single programs or applications.

5.	The main goal of Software Engineering is to develop software applications for improving quality,  budget, and time efficiency.

6.	Software Engineering ensures that the software that has to be built should be consistent, correct, also on budget, on time, 
and within the required requirements
